    \par \hspace{15pt} In this project, the group would like to investigate some of the existing Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for music composition/generation. More particularly, the group would like to produce a drum beats generator model. The group is also expecting to make some improvements on the existing models, so that the training of the model would be attainable with the limited hardware resources for this course project.
