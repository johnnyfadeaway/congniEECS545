    \par\hspace{15pt} The most related work to this project is MuseGAN.\cite{musegan} It is a multi-track sequential generative adversarial network. It is the state-of-the-art at its time for symbolic music generation, and is one of the only known models for generating polyphonic music. MuseGAN proposed 3 models to generate music: jamming model, composer model, and hybrid model. The team plans to employ the hybrid model from MuseGAN to generate the drum track.

\begin{par}
    \par One unique thing about MuseGAN is that its music input format is called pianoroll. Majority of the music genre classification models like \cite{tzanetakis2002musical} use MP3 format for their inputs. There have been few music genre classification models that use pianoroll format as input. the team would be one of the first individuals to try to classify music genres using pianoroll.

\begin{par}
    \par Some of non-music related classification models use supspace learning to do classification, for example, \cite{pca}. The team would like to see how subspace learning perfroms in the music genre classification area.
