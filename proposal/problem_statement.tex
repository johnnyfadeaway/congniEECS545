    \par \hspace{15pt} In this project, the group would like to investigate some of the existing Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for music composition/generation. More particularly, the group would like to produce a drum beats generator model, which would take the complete tracks from the other musical instruments, and try to generate a drum track sequentially based on these provided other tracks. 
    
    % The group is expecting to make some improvements on an existing models, MuseGAN \cite{musegan}, so that it would be more suitable for the project's objective and more attainable in terms of training with limited computation resources.
