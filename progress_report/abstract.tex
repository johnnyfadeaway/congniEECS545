    Comparing to Vision, Audio generation has always been a field that is less studied with deep learning. In ths course project, a lightened version of a temporal music generator MuseGAN \cite{musegan}, Tempo-Lite, is proposed. The Tempo-Lite model takes the existing tracks of musical instruments other than drum and generate complementary drum tracks for the existing tracks. As a milestone of this objective, the group has also provided classification methods and model for the Pianoroll representation of music signals. Although the project is still in progress, the classification models has shown some promising results that can be used in following stages. The group has also finished the Generator and will soon be tested once the Discriminator is finished.
