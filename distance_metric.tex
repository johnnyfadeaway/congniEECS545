    \par \hspace{15pt} To evaluate the similarity between the generated vector and 
    the vector in the data sample-i.e. to check whether the model-generated drum beats 
    fit with provided music notes-we propose (as an initial proposition) to use Euclidean distance for 
    measuring the similarity between two vectors. Specifically, the group is considering L1 or L2 
    distance metric. The error calculation works as the following: 
    \begin{equation}
        \emph{J}(w) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \norm{G(\mathbf{z})-x^{(i)}}
        
    \end{equation}
    where $G(\mathbf{z})$ represents generated drum beat vector, and $x^{(i)}$
    represents the data sample in training data set. The discriminator will denote the generated drum 
    beat as adequate as long as the above error is lower than a threshold value.
