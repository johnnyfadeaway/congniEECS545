    \par \hspace{15pt} Because of the large scale of music data representation, doing training data Diminsion Reduction (DR) and Principal Component Analysis(PCA) are essential to a lighter-load training process. Some related works use singular value decomposition(SVD) to find principal components to approximate the structure of the training data.[5] For the music genre classification task of this project, the team currently plans to first group the training data into different music genres, and then use SVD to obtain an orthonormal basis for each genre space. After having learned the genre subspaces, classfication can be done by comparing the projections of one particular test data onto the orthogonal complement of the genre subspaces.
