    \par \hspace{15pt} Comparing to the copious deep learning researches in vision, acoustic generative networks are less studied. However, the demand of music composition and professional music composers are expected to go up in the next few years. Unlike professional composers, amateur composers may not be able to write out scores for all musical instruments --- they are likely to be relatively more familiar to one or few musical instruments than others. In that case, our model can be a beneficial resource towards the amateur composers with their compositions. Although the focus of this course project is only on drum track generation, with properly labeled dataset and training, it should be able to work on other musical instruments as well. Moreover, since the aim of the group is to provide a computationally-light training model, it can be easily re-trained towards different musical instruments, even novel ones such as theremin or Kazoo with contemporary styles. Therefore, the group would argue that music generating neural network would be one of the most lucrative fields in the near future.
