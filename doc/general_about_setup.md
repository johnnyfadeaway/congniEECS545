All data is stored under`data/` but I have added everything in that to be ignored by git. Please download and extract your own data under that folder.

I was mainly using the [lpd-5-cleansed](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yz0Ma-6cWTl6mhkrLnAVJ7RNzlQRypQ5) dataset. There is a nifty tool called *gdown*, which was already included in the `requirement.txt`. Check how it can be used (I usually just run  \
`gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1yz0Ma-6cWTl6mhkrLnAVJ7RNzlQRypQ5`\
But since I haven't spend enough time on gdown's documentation, there's probably something else I should do or more elegant ways and stuff. Please let me know if you have found something. Thanks) and remeber to **CHECK YOUR `pwd` FIRST** and download the dataset under `data/`. If I see anyone pushed a dataset into the repo, **you are good as dead** 

(for real, please respect the repo and make sure you are committing reasonable stuff, as you have probably figured, I am spending a lot of non-constructive time with developping these documentation on very trivial stuff that I would expect you to know beforehand. It would be great if you can recognize my effort and help me with the project.).

Thanks and God bless.
