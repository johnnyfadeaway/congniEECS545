    \par \hspace{15pt} There are many different music styles such as Jazz, Blues and Rock. Each of these styles has its certain nuances, phrases, techniques, and sounds which are associated with the style of drumming that accompanies it. For example, Rock is characterized by the use of a backbeat while the most important aspect of jazz music is “swing”. We want to generate a perfect drum track that agrees with the style of our input music, thus, music genre classification is critical. In the previous study, several methods are utilized for the music genre classification. Beici Liang, Minwei Gu [1] proposed a transfer learning approach for audio-based classification of 11 western music genres. Congyue Chen, Xin Steven [2] combined transfer and active Learning for high accuracy. Lakshman K. Puppala et al [3] worked on music genre classification using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). Eamin Chaudary er al [4] employed Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Empirical Mode Decomposition. In this research, we will use subspace learning to classify genres.
