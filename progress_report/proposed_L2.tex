      \par To evaluate the similarity between the generated vector and 
      the vector in the data sample -- i.e. to check whether the model-generated drum beats 
      fit with provided music notes-we propose (as an initial proposition) to use Euclidean distance for 
      measuring the similarity between two vectors. Specifically, the group is considering L1 or L2 
      distance metric. The error calculation works as the following: 
      \begin{equation}
          \emph{J}(w) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\norm{G(\mathbf{z})-x^{(i)}})^2
      \end{equation}
      where $G(\mathbf{z})$ represents generated drum beat vector, and $x^{(i)}$
      represents the data sample in training data set. The discriminator will denote the generated drum 
      beat as adequate as long as the above error is lower than a threshold value.
