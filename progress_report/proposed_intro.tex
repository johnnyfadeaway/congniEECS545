    \par \hspace{15pt} Figure 1 shows the general pipeline of the proposed model. The model can be split into 2 parts: classification and generation. The output (before the last layer) of the classifier is fed into the generator as global induction. After that, the generator and the discriminator work together as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce the final output.
