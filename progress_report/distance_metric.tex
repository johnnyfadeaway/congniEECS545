      \par The team is planning to use the L2 distance between the song track vector produced by the Generator and the training set vector as a metric to measure the similarity between generated music and actual music. The other option would be to use the Wasserstein distance, which is a metric to measure the distance between two distributions-this can be used if the generated music and actual music are viewed as distributions. The last option would be most optimal but technically complicated, which is using a Discriminator network, training it along with the Generator network, and use it to tell if the generated song is "realistic" enough.
