    \par \hspace{15pt} For evaluations, the group would compare the model against its own variations listed above in the Approach section in Section \ref{sec:approach}. The group would compare the performance of the model and analyze why certain variants would perform better than the others. The group would also like to compare the results against some other similar models that has been proposed by others if the time permits, such as the NeuralBeats \cite{neuralbeats} and other DNN based drum generations \cite{lamb_of_God}.
